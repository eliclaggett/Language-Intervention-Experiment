                        This game is part of a research study conducted by Carnegie Mellon
                        University and is funded by the National Science Foundation.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Purpose</strong>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the research is to examine how people communicate and
                        cooperate with others.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Procedures</strong>
                    <p>
                        You will be expected to work on this task with other players. This task
                        consists of two stages. In the first stage, you will be expected to
                        communicate with one or more other players regarding assessments on
                        real-world topics. In the second stage, you will be expected to play a
                        decision-making game with the same counterparts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tutorial: before the task, you will complete a tutorial on how to do the
                        task. After the tutorial, you will be asked a few questions about your
                        understanding of the game. If you do not answer the questions correctly,
                        you will still receive the base pay of {formatMoney(gameParams.task1Pay)}, but you
                        are not eligible to join the task and the HIT again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those participants who are eligible to participate in the actual
                        game (due to answering the tutorial questions correctly), we may inform
                        you that we cannot use you for the game at that moment either because A)
                        we have more people than we need for a group at that time, or B) there
                        are not enough eligible participants to form a group at that time, so
                        the game will not happen then. Participants in both A and B will be paid
                        the base pay (as mentioned above) and may accept the HIT again in the
                        future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you fail the comprehension test or are not found a match, your
                        non-participation in the actual game will not result in a negative
                        rating on Prolific.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Participant requirements</strong>
                    <p>
                        Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older.
                        Only those located in the US at the time of their participation are
                        allowed to participate in this study.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Risks</strong>
                    <p>
                        We prohibit participants to send unkind or inappropriate messages during
                        this task. When you send such messages, we will report your violation to
                        Prolific. Although we conduct a careful
                        screening process, you might receive unkind or inappropriate messages
                        from another participant.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Benefits</strong>
                    <p>
                        You may learn about how to communicate with others. Also, the knowledge
                        received may be useful to others and to the scientific community by
                        clarifying how people communicate and cooperate with each other.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Compensation & Costs</strong>
                    <p>
                        You will be compensated the base pay of {formatMoney(gameParams.task1Pay)} for
                        beginning the study and completing the initial tutorial section. If you
                        are deemed eligible to participate in the actual game (by answering the
                        tutorial questions correctly), and you complete the game, you will also
                        receive a completion bonus of {formatMoney(gameParams.task2Pay)}. In
                        addition, those who participate in the game may earn a bonus up to
                        {formatMoney(gameParams.bonus + (gameParams.maxBonusShare * 2))} in a performance bonus based on the
                        decisions they make while playing the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
