## Research Paper

> **Note:**
> This repository is the companion code to our research paper under review. We do not recommend deploying this code for general use.

We conducted an experiment with 482 participants who communicated with either social in-group partners sharing their views or out-group partners with differing views, based on a preliminary survey. Participants received either "personalized" message suggestions aligned with their own views and conversation styles or "relational" suggestions using conversation styles tailored to whether their partner was in-group or out-group.  Following the conversations, participants engaged in a cooperation game designed to measure trust behaviorally. **Our results show that while personal assistance widened the cooperation gap, relational assistance significantly improved out-group cooperation to match in-group levels.**

For more details, please see our full paper in February 2025.
